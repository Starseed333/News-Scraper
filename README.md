# **News-Scraper**

### **Description**

A full stack application with persistent data using MongoDB. The web app lets users view and leave comments on the latest news from New York Times. The data is scraped from the New York Times using the Cheerio dependency. The app allows you to scrape the twenty most recent articles from the New York Times. It then gives you the option to save them into the saved articles tab. Once the article is saved you can post a comment on the note or if you change your mind you can go back and delete your comment. You can also delete any articles from the ones you have saved before. All this without any ads. It couldn't get any better!


### **MongoDB**

* mLab is remote MongoDB database that Heroku supports natively

* MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time

* The document model maps to the objects in your application code, making data easy to work with.

* Ad hoc queries, indexing, and real time aggregation provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data

* MongoDB is a distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use

* MongoDB is free and open-source, published under the GNU Affero General Public License
